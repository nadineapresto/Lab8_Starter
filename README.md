### How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation is the design process of first, building the application with full functionality implemented first, then ensuring they still operate in lower-performance machines or offline after the fact. Service workers support this approach by allowing web apps to function even without a network connection. Service workers intercept network requests from web apps and serve locally stored versions of files, enabling core features like loading pages and showing recipes to continue working offline or even under poor connectivity.
